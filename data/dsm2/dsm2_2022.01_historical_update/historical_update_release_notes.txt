Historical Update Release Notes

The current release of the DSM2 historical update extends the previous lease to December 2021.

Version Naming Change
DSM2 is changing its versioning scheme to allow for the code to be versioned separately from the historical input setup. To this end this release follows the new versioning scheme. 
Starting with this update, historical inputs will be released at a more frequent pace and will be versioned with the pattern of [year].[number]. E.g. This release is 2022.01 as it is the first release in 2022. 
It will further reference the version of the DSM2 code [currently 8.2.2] that was used to run this simulation and validate the results.
