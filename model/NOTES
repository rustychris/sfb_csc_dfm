 - inexplicably wedged before doing any real work.
   trying again.
 - and again (this time didn't even get through starting up the python script)
 - and a third time (creates dia files, but then stops)

Given that in one case it didn't even get through booting the script, seems
likely that it's a farm issue.

Running on c6-77 seems to never get off the ground.
Running on c4-86 seems to get stuck after doing some grid stuff, running dflowfm

Tried switching to z-layers. Seems to still be broken.
WTF.

4 domains (11,12,13,15) report ** INFO   : update_vertadmin: bl error, k=   4074
when run with z layers.

Maybe there are some nan bed elevations?

v021:
  WSE amplitude goes from 0.98 at SF to 0.94 Richmond, 0.96 Port Chicago.
  0.97-ish around Franks Tract, 0.94, 0.92 up through Liberty Island,
  1.05 near Stockton, 0.79-0.76 around DCC (except 1.26x on the south side of
  DCC), 0.8 by Freeport.

  Slightly fast propagating north, although too slow getting to DCC.

  Bias 0.06m *low* in the Bay across a few gages. Could pump it up 1%?
  And SF is lagging 885s.
