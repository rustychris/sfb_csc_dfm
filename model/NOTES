 - inexplicably wedged before doing any real work.
   trying again.
 - and again (this time didn't even get through starting up the python script)
 - and a third time (creates dia files, but then stops)

Given that in one case it didn't even get through booting the script, seems
likely that it's a farm issue.

Running on c6-77 seems to never get off the ground.
Running on c4-86 seems to get stuck after doing some grid stuff, running dflowfm

Tried switching to z-layers. Seems to still be broken.
WTF.

4 domains (11,12,13,15) report ** INFO   : update_vertadmin: bl error, k=   4074
when run with z layers.

Maybe there are some nan bed elevations?
